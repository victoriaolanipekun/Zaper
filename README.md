# Zaper

Zaper is an app I prototyped, designed and developed consuming a public API. I paticularly enjoyed this project as it allowed me explore my error handling skills as the API had some restrictions like CORS POLICY. I developed Zaper using React JS, and bootstrap for styling.

## Using NPM

`yarn start` or `yarn dev`  to run the development server

`yarn build` to create a build directory

## Using Yarn

`yarn start` or `yarn dev`  to run the development server

`yarn build` to create a build directory

### ⚠️

To prevent the `failed-to-compile` issue for linter errors like `no-unsed-vars`, rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and restart your development server. Note this will only change the behaviour of certain linter errors to now be warnings, and is added just to allow your code to compile in development. These errors should still be fixed and other errors will still result in the code being unable to compile

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
